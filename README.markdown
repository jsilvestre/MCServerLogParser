MC LogParser
=============================

## Introduction
MC LogParser parses your server.log files generated by Minecraft SMP servers.
It makes statistics from it.

Feel free to make suggestions or even add features by yourself (but do not forget to push them to me ;-)).


I know the code is dirty but I did it fast without thinking about how nice it could be :P

## Install
Just put the files in your web server.

## How to use it
Upload you server.log file via the admin page regularly and let the magics happen!
